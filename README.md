### Brief:
I have built a software engineering team generator command line application. The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. 

When the user has completed building the team, the application create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

This assignment also passes all unit tests.

### Lessons Learned:

  * LAST MINUTE HOMEWORK FOTI
  * Remember to npm install
  * Tests done by jest are really powerful if used correctly
  * TDD is not something I'm particularly comfortable with when designing something from scratch. I think it can be more handy when extending functionality of an existing program or working in a domain you're more comfortable with, like this instance
  * no time for bonus
